# Bot1, also known as "combineBot" is a bot that combines roles on Discord.
Lets say you want to ping someone in your server who lives in California and is also a girl, so you ping @Cali and @PS4.
With the current Discord ping system, you would ping EVERYONE is lives in Cali AND EVERYONE who is a PS4 Owner.
With the combineBot, your pings can now specifically locate the people who only have BOTH of those roles.
"/combine" combines ONLY the people who have both "@role1" and "@role2" who are online
"/combineall" combines ALL the people who have both "@role1" and "@role2", regardless of status.
Currently awaitng approval on Top.gg
